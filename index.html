        While the name "secretary bird" might not be super intimidating, this snake-killing badass savannah hunter rules
        over the grasslands of Sub-Saharan Africa. These birds are notorious for being vicious snake killers, making
        them a predator of predators. These unique-looking birds are the only ones of their kind, terrestrial hunters
        with long legs and beautiful plumage that can be used to disorient their prey. They are living fossils,
        basically more evidence that birds are just dinosaurs living among us. They look and hunt similarly to the
        extinct terror birds, large South American monsters known for being top predators.
        <br><br>
        These amazing hunters are some of the most interesting and unique raptors alive today, and secretary bird facts
        can be truly astounding. The secretary bird is a living natural wonder that can teach us about the past, as well
        as give some patients hope for a brighter future. Their large size, powerful legs, and hooked beaks make them
        deadly predators, but their strong bonds and monogamous mating habits show that there is much more to this bird
        than its deadly kick.
